# INTRO TO DATA ANALYSIS

In this project, we conduct our own data analysis and create a file to share that documents our findings. We started by taking a look at titanic dataset and brainstorming what questions we could answer using it. Then we use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions we are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.

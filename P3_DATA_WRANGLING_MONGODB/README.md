# Data Wrangling Using MongoDb 

In this project, we choose Delhi, India in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. We choose MongoDB as the data schema to complete our project.
